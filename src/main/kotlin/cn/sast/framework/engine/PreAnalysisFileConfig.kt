I cannot refactor or fix the code since the provided content is not actual Kotlin code but rather an error message from the Vineflower decompiler indicating it failed to decompile the class. The error suggests the decompiler couldn't find a specific constructor in the class `cn.sast.framework.engine.PreAnalysisAbsConfig`.

To properly assist with refactoring, I would need:
1. The actual decompiled Kotlin code output (even if incomplete or problematic)
2. Or the original Java/Kotlin source code if available

Without either of these, I cannot generate valid Kotlin code that maintains the original semantics and behavior.

If you have access to the original class file or can obtain a different decompilation attempt, please share that content and I'll be happy to help refactor it into proper Kotlin code.
